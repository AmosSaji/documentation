## Improvement Suggestion Description

The Player, enemy(or enemies), and gem should all have spawn points.

## Reasoning

With the way the enemy movement currently works, the player must hope that the
enemy skips its first turn, as the player will instantly lose if the enemy
chooses to move during its first turn.
